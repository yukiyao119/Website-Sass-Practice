        <h3>Tim Hawkey</h3>
        <h4>Chief Creative Officer</h4>
        <p>
          In healthcare advertising, Tim Hawkey is known as many
          things—creative innovator, raconteur, relentless optimist, and
          just plain relentless (to name a few). And while no one person
          can be all things to all people, everyone who knows Tim can
          agree on one thing—there’s no one quite like him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Co-leading AREA 23 since 2011 and AREA 23 on Hudson since
          2018, Tim’s commitment to innovation and ingenuity to
          transform pharmaceutical advertising has pushed the agency to
          crazy places—and paid off. In 2018, AREA 23 was recognized as
          the #1 Health Agency in the World, following other
          recognitions as Med Ad News Most Creative Agency for the third
          year running and Cannes Lions Health Agency of the Year in
          2017.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Do what scares you," Tim espouses to his creative teams. He
          believes that a great creative idea should challenge the
          customer and clients alike, even if that means implementing a
          little shock and awe from time to time. "If they don't stop
          and notice you, then everything you're doing is just a waste
          of time."
        </p>
        <p>
          What’s it all add up to? Results. Across all categories and
          audiences, the work that happens on Tim’s watch helps create
          brands that perform in the market. This includes some of the
          most notable launches of all time—Stelara, Shingrix,
          Jardiance—as well as the many challenger and specialty brands
          punching above their weight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before it all, Tim was an aspiring scientist, earning a BS in
          biology/organic chemistry from Skidmore College, where he
          graduated magna cum laude. The years that followed were spent
          on the bench—the lab bench—aiding in the preclinical
          investigation of the genetic etiology of breast cancer (p53
          and BRCA1) at New York’s Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taken altogether, it’s a lot. But when asked, Tim isn’t shy
          about letting it be known that when it comes to healthcare
          advertising, so much more is possible.
        </p>

        <h3>Renée Mellas</h3>
          <h4>President</h4>
          <p>
            Administrative Assistant. Account Executive. Leader.
            Entrepreneur. President. Renée has worn many hats over the
            course of her 25+ years career, but the thread that runs
            through it all is a desire to take on brands’ biggest
            challenges—and so far, she has conquered just about them all.
          </p>
          <p>
            As President of AREA 23 and AREA 23 on Hudson, and a
            co-founder of 2 start-up agencies (Wishbone and Calcium),
            Renée has tackled nearly every therapeutic category in markets
            domestic and global, professional and consumer. And it has
            informed what she sees as a core part of the AREA 23
            cocktail—network resources with start-up accountability.
          </p>
          <p>
            This mindset has been cultivated across a gamut of
            experiences, including management of smaller brands like
            Welchol, as well as vast blockbusters such as Shingrix, and
            everything in between. And if “management” stands out to you,
            good. It’s a core part of her philosophy—don’t just “service”
            brands, manage them; as if they were your own.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other core tenet of her philosophy is that creativity is
            the #1 difference maker agencies can offer clients. And it is
            this synergy between her and her partner, Chief Creative
            Officer Tim Hawkey, that unites AREA 23 in purpose to a degree
            that is seldom seen.
          </p>
          <p>
            The results speak for themselves. Growth from $17 million to
            $117 million. From 70 employees to 475. Recognition as the #1
            Healthcare agency in the world in 2018, Med Ad News Most
            Creative Agency for 3 years running, and Cannes Lions Agency
            of the Year in 2017.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to her feats in advertising, Renée was born in the Bronx
            and attended Iona College via an athletic scholarship to play
            Division 1 soccer. She ultimately received a BS in
            communications and an MS in journalism and PR. Renée now
            resides in Connecticut with her 2 daughters aged 12 and 14
            years, 2 dogs, 2 cats… and 1 husband.
